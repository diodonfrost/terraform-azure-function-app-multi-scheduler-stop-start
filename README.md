## Tests

Some of these tests create real resources in an Azure subscription. That means they cost money to run, especially if you don't clean up after yourself. Please be considerate of the resources you create and take extra care to clean everything up when you're done!

In order to run tests that access your Azure subscription, run 'azure login'

### End-to-end tests

#### Terraform test

```shell
# Test basic terraform deployment
cd examples/simple
terraform test -verbose

# Test postgresql scheduler
cd examples/postgresql_scheduler
terraform test -verbose
```
